- mesh building (add vert, add material transitions)
    - use this for the grid
    - and possibly for objmesh system?
    - needs a way to add user data to vertex for raycasting
      (or at least get the vertex index, so we can look up in a table)
- raycasting for mouse click detection
- speed up quad rendering with queueing
- mipmap generation on textures??


- pathing when interrupted (i.e. landscape changed)
